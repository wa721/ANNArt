# ANNArt
This project is concerned with making "art" using machine learning models.

The impetus behind this project is not to replace or make redundant art made by human artists; nor do I expect that the quality of the images produced will be anywhere near the quality required to achieve that.

Rather, this is an exploration of what algorithmic art might look like. How we might build these models, what works and what doesn't.

The first of these experiments will be working to recreate paintings given a number of input parameters. These will be quantified classifications (such as desired colours represented as three RGB numbers, numbers of objects as an integer, the subject of the art to perhaps be a integer code), and other characteristics present in some popular image datasets.

The first models made in this project will be regressive neural networks made using Sci-Kit Leanr MLPRegressor Aritificial Neural Networks.
